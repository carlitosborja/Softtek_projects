# Softtek_projects
Here you can find the two projects that Softtek asked me to develop for my Softtek job application.

There are two projects in this repository:
* Python_pandas_project
  For using this modules functions, you have to import the module (Python_pandas_project) into your Python script or notebook.
  Keep in mind that this module file should be in the same path as your Python script or notebook.
* MySQL_project

## Python_pandas_project

This is a module that includes the next functions, in order to give solution to the three Python / pandas tasks presented by Softtek.

* detect_change: given consecutive days in a dataframe and their weather (rainy / not rainy), return the days for which the weather got rainy.
* seasons: given some order dates in a dataframe, return the order_id and the season of the year the order was created.
* df_status: given a dataframe with order, its articles and article's status (shipped, pending or cancelled) returns the order overall status.

## MySQL_project
This is only a .txt file which includes the command lines necesarry to perform cthe requested queries and statements on MySQL.
