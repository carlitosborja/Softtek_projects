# Softtek_projects
Here you can find any related project, exercise or exam that I (Carlos Borja) have done for my Softtek job application.

There are two projects in this repository:
* Python-pandas project
* MySQL project

## Python-pandas project
This includes the next functions.
* detect_change: given consecutive days in a dataframe and their weather (rainy / not rainy), return the days for which the weather got rainy.
* seasons: given some order dates in a dataframe, return the order_id and the season of the year the order was created.
* df_status: given a dataframe with order, its articles and article's status (shipped, pending or cancelled) returns the order overall status.
